#CSS-Temple

[This is a collection of CSS based decisions.](https://anilator.github.io/CSS-Temple/)

###List of contents:
- [Sticky footer](https://anilator.github.io/CSS-Temple/#0) based on `display: table-row` property. Footer height is not fixed. Supported by all browsers newer than IE7.
- [Striked header](https://anilator.github.io/CSS-Temple/#1) with multiline support.
- [Border breaked by image](https://anilator.github.io/CSS-Temple/#2) based on `display: table`. It's kinda hacky, but supports different image heights and text volumes.
