# CSS-Temple

[This is a collection of CSS based decisions.](https://klimcode.github.io/CSS-Temple/)

### Includes:
- [Sticky footer](https://anilator.github.io/CSS-Temple/#0) based on `display: table-row` property. 
Footer's height is not fixed. IE8+.
- [Striked header](https://anilator.github.io/CSS-Temple/#1) with multiline support. IE8+.
- [Border breaked by image](https://anilator.github.io/CSS-Temple/#2) based on `display: table`. 
It's kinda hacky, but supports different image heights and text volumes. IE8+.
